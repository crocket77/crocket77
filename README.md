Hello, I’m Ethan and I am learning how to be a full stack developer. 

- I’m interested in devloping websites that are both fun and useful
- I’m currently learning the MERN stack and continuing my education in web development.
- I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects.

My current main project is Life Sherpa in the JASEalive repo. It is a mentor website developed to help people pass on their life's knowledge and help others out.
